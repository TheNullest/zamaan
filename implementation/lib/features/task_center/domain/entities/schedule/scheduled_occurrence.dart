/// Represents a single scheduled occurrence (instance) of a task within the system.
///
/// This entity acts as the **bridge between planned scheduling and real execution**,
/// defining *when* a task is expected to run and *how* it should behave within
/// its scheduled lifecycle. It supports both **precise time-bound** and **flexible,
/// anytime** scheduling modes through the [timeMode] property.
///
/// ## Relationship with TaskActivity
/// - **This Entity** → Defines the **intended schedule and execution state**
/// - **TaskActivity** → Captures the **actual execution and runtime behavior**
///
/// Each `ScheduledOccurrenceEntity` may have zero or more related `TaskActivity`
/// records, enabling full traceability between *planned* and *executed* outcomes.
///
/// ## Key Responsibilities
/// - Represent scheduled execution windows via [startDateTime] and [endDateTime]
/// - Define scheduling flexibility and temporal precision via [timeMode]
/// - Identify the originating schedule through [schedulerId] and [schedulerType]
/// - Maintain sequence ordering across recurring or dependent occurrences
/// - Track runtime progress and status through [occurrenceStatus] and [successPercentage]
/// - Capture contextual notes in [description] for:
///   - Exception handling or failure reasoning
///   - Special scheduling conditions
///   - Cancellations or deferrals
///   - Rescheduling justifications
///
/// ## Validation Rules
/// - [successPercentage] must be between 0–100 (inclusive)
/// - [endDateTime] must occur after [startDateTime] (when [timeMode] is time-bound)
/// - [sequenceNumber] must be non-negative
///
/// ## Hive Storage
/// - Base entity fields (e.g., id, userId, timestamps) occupy indices 0–10
/// - This class uses fields starting from index 11
/// - Ensure type adapters are registered for all enum fields (e.g., [OccurrenceStatus], [ScheduledTimeMode])
///
/// ## Usage Notes
/// - [timeMode] allows hybrid scheduling — from fixed hourly plans to free-form daily execution
/// - [timezone] ensures cross-region consistency for start and end times
/// - [copyWith] supports immutable modification for safe, predictable updates
/// - [props] enable value-based equality for robust state management and caching
///
/// This entity is a **core element of the scheduling engine**, providing a unified
/// abstraction for all task occurrences — from strictly timed reminders to flexible,
/// day-level activities.
